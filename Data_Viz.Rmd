# Now let us look at some of the graphs. In Data analysis we found that age Pclass and sex were quite good columns for model and let us visually see them.

#set the colors for graphs
colset <- c("#0072B2", "#D55E00" ,"#CC79A7")
#boxplot
plot(trn$Age~trn$Survived,col=colset,xlab='Survived',ylab='Age',main="Survived vs Age")
# survived has 25th percentile on lower side as compared to not survived.
#mosaic plot style where age will be divided into 10 buckets andit will provide hows the survial rate is in these brackeets.
plot(trn$Survived~trn$Age,col=colset,xlab='Age',ylab='Survived',main="Age (Brackets) sv Survived")
# Here age was divided into intervals of 10's and the breadth of interval corresponds to the number of people.

#As you could see that more people survived in 0-10 an d11-20 as compared to 20-30 and for 30-40 more people survived.

#Now let us have a look at sex columns
plot(trn$Survived,trn$Sex,col=colset,xlab='Sex',ylab='Survived',main="Survived vs Sex")

#This is another way to look at the graph
plot(trn$Survived~trn$Sex,col=colset,xlab='Sex',ylab='Survived',main="Survived vs Sex")

# This clearly shows the distinction and as you could see that the survival for females are much higher than males.

#Now let us have a look at Pclass columns
plot(trn$Survived~trn$Pclass,col=colset,xlab='Travel Class',ylab='Survived',main="Survived vs Travel Class")
plot(trn$Survived,trn$Pclass,col=colset,xlab='Travel Class',ylab='Survived',main="Survived vs Travel Class")
# It clearly shows that people in 3rd class had very less chance of survival as compared to 2nd and 1st class. In fact chances of survival in First class are highest.

#try sibsp columns. I have defined just 3 colors
plot(trn$Survived~trn$SibSp,col=colset,xlab='Siblings & Sposues',ylab='Survived',main="Survived vs Number of Siblings & Spouses")

# here you could see that the chances of survival when you have 1 or 2 siblings and spuses were high. The breadth of these graphs corresponds to the count and thus you could see that most of the people were without sibling and spouses on aboard.

#try Parch columns
plot(trn$Survived~trn$Parch,col=colset,xlab='Parch',ylab='Survived',main="Survived vs Number of Parents & Childs")

# here you could see that the chances of survival when you have 1 or 2 Parch and spuses were high. The breadth of these graphs corresponds to the count and thus you could see that most of the people were without sibling and spouses on aboard.

#Now let us see for portof embarkment

#try Embarked columns
plot(trn$Survived~trn$Embarked,col=colset,xlab='Port of Embarkment',ylab='Survived',main="Survived vs Port of Embarkment")

# Here it looks like that the chances of survival are higher if you boarded from Cherbourg and very less chances when you boarded from Southampton.

#try the fare
plot(trn$Survived~trn$Fare,col=colset,xlab='Fare',ylab='Survived',main="Survived vs Fare")

#As the fare amount increases there are high chances of survival and this looks like correlared with the Pclass column which we already know that explains the survival.

# Now let us take an example where it is possible that there were more females say in Pclass 1 and that is why the success rate is high or vice versa and this is the same case for any combination of the columns. Now  we will look at these interactions as well.

mosaicplot(~ Sex + Pclass + Survived, data = trn, color = colset, xlab= "Sex", ylab ="Travel Class",main="Mosaic Plot for Sex, Travel Class and Survived" )

# This is an intersting graph.It shows that if you were a Female from First and Second class chances were much higher as compared to anything else. Although, males from class 1 and 2 has much higher rate of survival as compared to people from 3rd class.

# Females in 1st class had very high rate of survivall and in 3rd class this rate is around 50%.

#Males in 1st class has very high rate but it is not better than the female in 3rd class and thus it looks like that sex was more dominant feature here.

#sex embarked
mosaicplot(~ Sex + Embarked + Survived , data = trn, color = colset,xlab= "Sex", ylab ="Port Of Embarkment",main="Mosaic Plot for Sex, Port Of Embarkment and Survived" )

#Here you could see that if you were Male from the Queenstown then survival chances were quite less as compared to males from other places..

#Travle class embarked
mosaicplot(~ Pclass + Embarked + Survived , data = trn, color = colset,xlab= "Travel Class", ylab ="Port Of Embarkment",main="Mosaic Plot for Travel Class, Port Of Embarkment and Survived" )

#Now put all of these together and see how it will work

mosaicplot(~ Sex + Pclass + Embarked + Survived , data = trn, color = colset,xlab= "Sex/Port Of Embarkment", ylab ="Travel Class/Survived",main="Mosaic Plot for Sex,Travel Class, Port Of Embarkment and Survived" )

# There are some intersting facts here. E.g. Males from Queenstown had very less chance of survival irrespective of class. In fact only surived looks from 3rd class.But there are just 1,1 people in these classes. Also, for males port of embarkement did not matter in the first and second class. Howvere, there is a difference for 3rd class.

#For females howevere, the port of emabarkment had differnece for second class and 3rd class both.

table(trn$Pclass,trn$Sex,trn$Embarked)

mosaicplot(~ Sex + Parch  + Survived , data = trn, color = colset,xlab= "Sex", ylab ="Number of Parents & Childs",main="Mosaic Plot for Sex,Number of Parents & Childs and Survived" )

#for males it looks like that as the number of Parch increased the chances of survival were much better for females it was other way around.

mosaicplot(~ Sex + SibSp  + Survived , data = trn, color = colset,xlab= "Sex", ylab ="Number of Siblings & Spouses",main="Mosaic Plot for Sex,Number of Siblings & Spouses and Survived" )

#It shows the same trend as Parent and Child except that there is an exception for femals when value is 3 and I am sure that it is just a small number and only 0,1,2 will have serious impact on how good this feature is.
